# CHAPTER 1

## REVIEW OF THE KEY IDEAS 1.1
1. A vector $v$ in two-dimensional space has two conponents $v_1$ and $v_2$.
2. $v+w=(v_1+w_1, v_2+w_2)$ and $cv=(cv_1, cv_2)$ are found a component at a time.
3. A linear combination of threee vectors $u$ and $v$ and $w$ is $cu+dv+ew$.
4. Take all linear combinations of $u$, or $u$ and $v$, or $u,v,w$. In three dimensions, those combinations typically fill a line, then a plane, then the whole space $R^3$.
